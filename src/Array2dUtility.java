public class Array2dUtility {

    // Declare all methods as static.

    // 1. print
    // Implement a method called print that prints out the values of a 2D array of integers row by row.

    // 2. sum
    // Implement a method called sum that returns the sum of a 2D array of integers

    // 3. average
    // Implement a method called average that returns the average value of a 2D array of integers.
    // You may assume that the 2D array is a square. That is, it has the same number of rows and columns.
    // Reminder: call your sum method within the average method.

    // 4. minimum
    // Implement a method called minimum that returns the minimum value of a 2D array of integers.

    // 5. maximum
    // Implement a method called maximum that returns the maximum value of a 2D array of integers.

    // 6. evenCountStandard
    // Implement a method called evenCountStandard that returns the number of even numbers in a 2D array of integers.
    // Use a standard for loop to implement this method.

    // 7. evenCountEnhanced
    // Implement a method called evenCountEnhanced that returns the number of even numbers in a 2D array of integers.
    // Use an enhanced for loop to implement this method.

    // 8. allPositive
    // Implement a method called allPositive that returns true if all the values in a 2D array of integers are positive.

    // 9. rowSums
    // Implement a method called rowSums that returns a one dimensional array that contains the sum of each row at each index.

    // 10. colSums
    // Implement a method called colSums that returns a one dimensional array that contains the sum of each col at each index.
